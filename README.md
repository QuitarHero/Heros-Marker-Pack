# Hero's Marker Pack

This Marker Pack is developed by QuitarHero. This branch's focus is Blish HUD compatitability. New features will be added, everything is getting an overhaul, existing features will be edited to be more intuitive, and more. Note that if you choose to use what's currently in development, defaults and other features will not work as intended. Refer to the list below to see what is and isn't done, and what's currently being worked on.

The purpose of this pack is to enhance my Guild Wars 2 gameplay with guides, markers, trails, and timers. It is not to add every little detail anyone can think of, regardless if it's less or more efficient.
