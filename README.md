# Hero's Marker Pack

This Marker Pack is developed by QuitarHero.

The purpose of this pack is to enhance my Guild Wars 2 gameplay with markers, trails, and timers for strategies and skips I perform. It's not a pack designed to give people an advantage over others (besides knowledge), nor will it be a pack for every strategy and skip known. Once you know all the strategies and skips this pack provides, it shouldn't be required afterwards.

THIS IS A REWORK WIP!
But what's available works (for the most part).
