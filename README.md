# Hero's Taco Pack

This Tac0 Pack is developed by QuitarHero.

The purpose of this pack is to enhance my Guild Wars 2 gameplay with guides, markers, trails, and timers. It is not to add every little detail anyone can think of, regardless if it's less or more efficient.

## Features of this pack:

## Map Timer:
*I know this is by default in tac0, but I tailored it to my preferences. As such there are no World Bosses, Hardcore Bosses, Dry Top, and Ley Line Anomalies in this timer.*
- Daytime, and HoT metas are edited to be more intuitive.
- Desert Highlands' Buried Treasure meta is listed.
- Domain of Istan's Palawadan meta is listed.
