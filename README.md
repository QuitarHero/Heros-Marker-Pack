# Hero's Marker Pack

This Marker Pack is developed by QuitarHero.

The purpose of this pack is to enhance my Guild Wars 2 gameplay with markers, trails, and timers for strategies and skips I and my groups perform. This is not a marker pack for every strategy and skip known, but rather to assist in basic and more advanced strategies for Fractals and Raids. Once you know all the strategies and skips this pack provides, it shouldn't be required afterwards.

THIS IS A REWORK WIP!
But what's available works (for the most part).
