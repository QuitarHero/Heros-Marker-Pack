# Hero's Marker Pack

This Marker Pack is developed by QuitarHero.

The purpose of this pack is to enhance my Guild Wars 2 gameplay with markers, trails, and timers for strategies and skips I perform. It's not a pack designed to give people an advantage over others (besides knowledge), nor will it be a pack for every strategy and skip known. Once you know all the strategies and skips this pack provides, it shouldn't be required afterwards.

THIS IS A REWORK WIP!
But what's available works (for the most part)

### Notes:
- **1\*** Waiting for improved Blish support for `title` functionality.
- **3\*** Waiting for Blish support of `behavior` functionality.
- **4\*** Waiting for Blish support of `timer` functionality.
- **5\*** Waiting for improved Blish support for `rotate` functionality.
- **6\*** Waiting for Blish support of `bounce-distance` functionality.
- **7\*** Waiting for Blish support for API functionality.
- **8\*** Waiting for Blish support of cross-marker behavioral functionality.
