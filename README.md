# Hero's Marker Pack

This Marker Pack is developed by QuitarHero.

This pack is aimed at individuals that want their instanced content to be a lot cooler and more interesting, providing guides to various skips and useful information throughout Raids, Fractals, and Strikes. This pack won't teach you from scratch everything you may want to know, but instead works together with players that have class/build knowledge to fully understand what's provided.
