# Heros-Taco-Pack

This Tac0 Pack is developed by QuitarHero.

The purpose of this pack is to enhance my Guild Wars 2 gameplay with guides, markers, trails, and timers. It is not to add every little detail anyone can think of, regardless if it's less or more efficient.

### Features of this pack:
- Fractal of the Mists markers, trails, and guidelines to various skips and optimizations, such as Colossus Spawns in Solid Ocean.
- Raid markers, trails, guidelines, and timers to encounter mechanics and optimizations, such as Cairn's Agony Application.
