# Hero's Marker Pack

This Marker Pack is developed by QuitarHero.

This pack provides skip guides, mechanical optimization, encounter strategy support, and general QoL markers for Fractals of the Mists, Raids, Strikes, and Dungeons, in addition to limited build support for SFTA. Individuals who are significantly experienced in end-game PvE content will see little to no use from this pack, and the same goes for brand new players. But if you're someone who doesn't fit in either extreme, then this pack will suit you well.

I develop this pack with the uses that I'd have for it foremost, with additional strategy & marker support at reasonable request. As such, I may do strategies that you (and your group) may not do, so take strategical markers with a grain of salt.
