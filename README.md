# Hero's Marker Pack

This Marker Pack is developed by QuitarHero. This branch's focus is Blish HUD compatitability. New features will be added, everything is getting an overhaul, existing features will be edited to be more intuitive, and more.

The purpose of this pack is to enhance my Guild Wars 2 gameplay with markers, trails, and timers for strategies and skips I perform. It's not a pack designed to give people an advantage over others (besides knowledge), nor will it be a pack for every strategy and skip known. Once you know all the strategies and skips this pack provides, it shouldn't be required afterwards.

### Notes:
- **1\*** Waiting for improved Blish support for `title` functionality.
- **2\*** Waiting for improved Blish support for `trail` functionality.
- **3\*** Waiting for Blish support of `behavior` functionality.
- **4\*** Waiting for Blish support of `timer` functionality.
