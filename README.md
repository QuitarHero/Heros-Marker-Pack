# Hero's Marker Pack

This Marker Pack is developed by QuitarHero.

This pack provides skip guides, mechanical optimization, encounter strategy support, automatic raid tracking, and general QoL markers for Fractals of the Mists, Raids, Strikes, and Dungeons. Additionally provides limited Open World support for Homestead and Janthir Wilds' related materials and gathering. Individuals who are significantly experienced in end-game PvE content will see little to no use from this pack, and the same goes for brand new players. But if you're someone who doesn't fit in either extreme, then this pack will suit you well.
